The admin has a dashboard for which he can view:

<!-- 1. developers available -->

<!-- 2. list of developers for every client or role -->
<!-- 3. list of clients. -->

4. New clients or roles available for vacancy and the skills required, and match developers according to that skill.
5. Clocked hours of every active developer with a role.
6. View list of developers without a role.
7. Insert new roles available for vacancy.
8. Admin can assign interviews to developers
   The developers also has a dashboard where they can view.
   1.The list of interviews they have with new incoming developers,
9. Developers can schedule questions they will ask or have an Ai assistant embeded to ask question anytime they want to.
   Now with the developers there will be two types, in house developers and external developers pending interview or acceptance.

The Hr also has a dashboard where they can:

1. Insert new roles available for vacancy just like the admin.
2. Hr can assign interviews to developers, and an email will be sent to them as a reminder, that is the interviewer and interviewyee.
3. View list of developers who has submitted their resume for a specific role or job available.
   The Marketing can insert.
4. The clocked hours for every active developer by day, weeks or month.
5. They can send email reminders to active developers on holidays, weekly report submition to client and so forth.

Now everytime there is a role available, the role will be inserted into the system, and a link will be generated and can be shared to other external developers on other platforms to apply for that job, the job application form will be the standard where they can insert the name resume, years of experience, answer some few question about their background, submit resume and cover letter and so forth. Once they apply, they will be filtered by relevancy or qualification by either the hr or admin, and once shortlisted, and interview with the interview-type can be scheduled with an in house developer and developerÂ shorlisted.
